Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, advised a calm and rational approach when dealing with criticism or insults from others.In his work On Anger(De Ira), 
Seneca suggested that when someone speaks ill of you, you should respond with tranquility and not let anger or resentment take control.
His reasoning is rooted in Stoic philosophy, which emphasizes that we cannot control what others do or say, only how we react to it.
One of his famous quotes on this topic is:
"What difference does it make, after all, what your position in life is if you dislike it yourself? All that matters is how you deal with your situation."
The Stoic approach would be to detach emotionally from external criticism and focus on maintaining inner peace and virtue.Rather than seeking revenge or being troubled by others
opinions, Seneca advocated for self-reflection and understanding that such insults are often a reflection of the other personâ€™s character, not yours.
